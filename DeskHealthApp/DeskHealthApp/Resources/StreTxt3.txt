Trunk Rotation
    Keep your feet firmly on the ground, facing forward.
    Twist your upper body in the direction of the arm that’s resting on the back of your chair.
    Hold pose for 10 to 30 seconds.
    Repeat on other side.

Tip: Exhale as you lean into the stretch for a greater range of motion.
